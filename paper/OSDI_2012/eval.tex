\subsection{Effect of Ballooning}
\label{sec:ballooining}

Research questions
\begin{smitemize}
\item{How much does it going to reduce overlay size?}
\item{How far does the ballooning will degrade application performance?}
\item{Does the Base VM have to be the status where ballooning is 
applied to get ballooning effect on overlay VM?}
\end{smitemize}
