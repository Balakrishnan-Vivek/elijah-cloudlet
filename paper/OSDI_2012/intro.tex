\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Offloading resource-intensive computation from a mobile device to the
cloud in order to extend battery life or to speed up execution has
been the subject of many recent papers~\cite{Chun2011}. These
papers are rooted in work stretching back over a decade on the theme
of {\em cyber foraging}~\cite{Balan2002,Satya2001}.  Commercial
applications that use cloud offload now exist: Apple's {\em Siri} for
speech recognition on the iPhone is a good example~\cite{SiriURL}.  An
ongoing convergence of mobile computing and cloud computing is clearly
under way.
