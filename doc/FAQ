	ANS:

	First of all, it assumes use of KVM. So please delete virtualbox and run it with kvm.
	(Virtualbox and KVM cannot be installed and run at the time. They're conflict each other/)
	Reason of this error is, it failed to connect to qemu(kvm) command line interface 
	when it tries to generate memory snapshot. That means, kvm does not properly launched your VM. 
	So, I would guess that you have not see any of running VM when you run this command. 
	The script supposes to run your VM when you execute "./cloudlet.py -b ~" and will 
	automatically connect VM though VNC GUI. Then, it will generate  base VM(disk image and memory) 
	when you close your VNC GUI.
	So my recommendation is to use KVM and check you can see VNC GUI when you execute this command.
