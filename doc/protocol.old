This document explains protocol between client to synthesis server.
All communication channel uses TCP connection.

PROTOCOL - Simplified
-----------------------------
For research purpose, here we currently use simplfied version
excluding discovery, resource negociation, and Base VM discovery process.

Simplified protocol is composed of single message of overlay binary transfer
information, and following server response. And it uses JSON formatted string
to avoid platform and language dependency.

1. Client request VM launch
  -Transfered data 
    [length of JSON header(4 byte), JSON formatted header(variable)]

  -JSON formatted header
  	required key: 'VM' array, which has
  	  base_name(Base VM Name that has to be listed in configuration file of synthesis server),
  	  diskimg_size(overlay disk image size)
  	  memory_snapshot_size(overlay memory snapshot size)

  	example
  	  {
  	    "VM": [
	      {
	        "base_name": "Ubuntu_10.04"
	        "diskimg_size": "96958895"
	        "memory_snapshot_size": "19827612"
	        and you have enabled ```Early VM Start``` option at server-side.
	        }
	    ]
	  }


2. Server reponse
  -Transfered Data
    [length of ret JSON(4 byte), JSON formatted return(variable)]

  -JSON formatted return
  	required key: command number, return string, LaunchVM ip address

  	example
  	  {
  	    "command": 0x22
  	    "return": "SUCCESS"
  	    "LaunchVM-IP": "128.2.121.242"
  	  }
